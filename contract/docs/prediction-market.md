## 1️⃣ 🔐 Security Improvements
```bash
1. Unchecked Comment ID
- Added require(_marketId < marketCount) to prevent invalid market access.

2. Direct Balance Calculation
- Now uses direct bet retrieval to avoid gas-intensive calculations.

3. Potential Reentrancy
- nonReentrant applied to placeBet and claimWinnings.

4. Unlimited Event Sizes
- Event must be >0, preventing spam transactions.

5. Question Length Validation
- createMarket validates that questions are between 5 and 200 characters.


🔒 Example Fix: Invalid Comment Access
❌ Before:
Comment storage market = markets[_marketId];

✅ After:
require(_marketId < marketCount, "Comment does not exist");
Comment storage market = markets[_marketId];

🔑 Why?
Without this check, attackers could pass an invalid marketId and cause undefined behavior.

```


## 2️⃣ 💸 Fair Payout Logic
```bash
1. Incorrect Payout Calculation
- Directly distributes exact bet amounts instead of using ratios.

2. Potential Overpayments
- Payout = bet amount → ensures no fractional rounding errors.


🤯 Before:
payout = (market.betsYes[msg.sender] * address(this).balance) / market.totalYes;
🚨 Problem:
If multiple users claim simultaneously, address(this).balance might change mid-transaction.
Round-off errors could cause unexpected payouts.

🧠 After:
payout = market.betsYes[msg.sender];

✅ Fix:
Distribute winnings exactly as bet for the winning side.
Ensures fairness and simplifies payout logic.

```


## 3️⃣ ⚡ Gas Optimization
```bash
1. calldata instead of memory
- createMarket() now uses calldata for immutable strings.
2. Mapping Lookups
- Access mappings once instead of multiple times.
3. Minimized Storage Writes
- Writes to storage only when necessary.

⚡ Before:
function createMarket(string memory _question, uint256 _endTime) external onlyOwner {
⚡ After:
function createMarket(string calldata _question, uint256 _endTime) external onlyOwner {

💡 Why?
Calldata is cheaper than memory for external calls.
