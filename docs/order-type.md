A **Limit Order** allows users to specify the price they want to buy or sell at.
- **Buy Order**: Waits until the price **falls to or below** the specified amount.
- **Sell Order**: Waits until the price **rises to or above** the specified amount.
- The order is executed **automatically** when the market reaches the specified price.

### ðŸ“Œ Features
- Greater control over price but may not be executed if the market doesn't reach the specified price.

    - **Buy Limit** at `$0.15`.
    - The order executes **automatically** when the price reaches `$0.15` or lower.
- Conversely, if the **Chance** is `30%` but you want to **Sell** when it **rises to 40%**:
    - **Sell Limit** at `$0.40`.
    - The order executes **automatically** when the price reaches `$0.40` or higher.

### ðŸ“Œ Example
- If you bought **Yes shares**:
    - `1000 shares` at `$0.20` and `500 shares` at `$0.25`,
    - These are managed as **two separate trades**.
    - Using **Merge**, they become **1500 Yes shares** managed as one position.
    - The **average price** is calculated automatically.

## ðŸ”¥ 4. Split (Dividing Shares)

    - Sell `1000 shares` at `$0.35` (**Sell Limit**).
    - Sell the other `1000 shares` at `$0.40` (**Sell Limit**).
    - This allows for **diverse selling strategies** to **maximize profit**.
